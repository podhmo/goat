# Potential Refactoring Areas

This document outlines potential areas for refactoring in the `goat` codebase. These are suggestions aimed at improving code clarity, maintainability, and robustness.

## 1. Error Handling and Propagation

- **Consistent Error Wrapping:** Review error handling throughout the `internal/` packages. Ensure errors from lower-level functions (e.g., `os` package calls, file I/O, AST parsing) are consistently wrapped with context (e.g., using `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)`) before being returned up the call stack. This helps in debugging and understanding the root cause of errors.
- **Custom Error Types:** For common error conditions specific to `goat`'s domain (e.g., "run function not found", "options struct not found", "invalid marker usage"), consider defining custom error types. This can make error checking more robust than relying on string comparisons (e.g., `if errors.Is(err, ErrRunFuncNotFound)`).

## 2. Code Duplication

- **Analyzer Logic:** The different analyzers in `internal/analyzer/` (`initializer_analyzer.go`, `options_analyzer.go`, `run_func_analyzer.go`) might share common AST traversal or node inspection logic. Explore if common utility functions or a base analyzer structure could reduce duplication.
- **Argument Parsing in `cmd/goat/main.go`:** The `main` function in `cmd/goat/main.go` parses flags for multiple subcommands (`emit`, `scan`, `help-message`). While `flag.NewFlagSet` is used, there might be opportunities to further consolidate flag definitions or shared logic if subcommands grow more complex.

## 3. Complexity and Clarity

- **`internal/interpreter/evaluator.go`:** This file is responsible for evaluating `goat.Default()` and `goat.Enum()` markers. Depending on its current complexity, ensure that the AST traversal and value extraction logic is clearly structured and well-commented. If it handles many different expression types, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions.
- **`internal/codegen/main_generator.go`:** Generating the `main()` function can become complex. Ensure the code generation logic is templated or structured in a way that's easy to follow and modify. If it involves a lot of string concatenation for code generation, consider using Go's `text/template` package for better readability and safety, though the current approach of building an AST and then printing it is generally good.
- **Large Functions:** Identify any functions that have grown too large and try to break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces with clear responsibilities. This applies across the codebase.

## 4. AST Traversal and Analysis (`internal/analyzer/`, `internal/interpreter/`)

- **Visitor Pattern:** For more complex AST traversals, consider using the `ast.Inspect` function or implementing a full `ast.Visitor` pattern. This can make the traversal logic more organized and easier to extend compared to manual recursive descents in multiple places.
- **Type Checking and Safety:** When extracting information from AST nodes, ensure robust type assertions and checks are in place to prevent panics if the AST structure is not as expected.

## 5. Modularity and Package Design

- **`internal/loader/loader.go`:** This package is responsible for loading Go files. Ensure its API is clean and it focuses solely on loading and parsing, without mixing in too much analysis logic (which should reside in `internal/analyzer/`).
- **`internal/metadata/types.go`:** This defines the structures that hold the extracted command information. As the tool evolves, ensure these structures remain well-organized and serve as a clear contract between the analysis phase and the generation/output phases.
- **Utils Packages:** The `internal/utils/` sub-packages (`astutils`, `stringutils`) are good for housing common helper functions. Continue to leverage these to keep other packages focused on their core responsibilities.

## 6. Testing Strategy

- **Table-Driven Tests:** For functions with multiple input conditions and expected outputs (common in analyzers and interpreters), use table-driven tests to ensure comprehensive coverage and readability.
- **Integration Tests for Subcommands:** While unit tests are crucial, also consider higher-level integration tests for each subcommand (`emit`, `scan`, `help-message`) that operate on sample Go files and verify the output (generated code, JSON, help text). The existing `examples/` directory could be leveraged for this.
- **Testing Error Conditions:** Ensure that error paths and invalid inputs are adequately tested for all key components.

## 7. Configuration and Options Handling

- **Centralized Configuration for `goat` tool:** The `main.go` for the `goat` tool itself parses command-line arguments. If the number of global options or subcommand options grows, consider structuring this configuration more formally, perhaps in its own struct, to make it easier to manage and pass around.

## 8. Comments and Documentation

- **Internal API Documentation:** Ensure that exported functions and types within the `internal/` packages have clear Godoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. This is crucial for maintainability, especially as the team or number of contributors grows.
