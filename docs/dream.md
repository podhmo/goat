# Future Dreams for Goat üêê

This document captures potential future enhancements, ambitious ideas, and 'dream' features for the `goat` tool. These go beyond the immediate roadmap and explore what `goat` could become.

## Enhanced Developer Experience

- **Lazy-Loading Interpreter (User Request):**
  - *Concept:* Develop an interpreter for the `Options` struct initialization (e.g., handling `goat.Default()`, `goat.Enum()`) that is extremely fast to start up. This would be beneficial in scenarios where `go build` time is part of the critical path for execution, and runtime speed of the interpreter itself is less critical than its initialization speed.
  - *Experimentation:* The current handling of `goat.Enum()` and `goat.Default()` can be seen as an early experiment in this direction, focusing on a limited subset of Go's syntax for fast parsing and evaluation without full compilation.
  - *Use Case:* Ideal for tools or scripts where the CLI definition might change frequently, and quick regeneration/re-evaluation is prioritized over the absolute runtime performance of the CLI parsing phase itself.
