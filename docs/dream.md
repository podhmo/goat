# Future Dreams for Goat 🐐

This document captures potential future enhancements, ambitious ideas, and 'dream' features for the `goat` tool. These go beyond the immediate roadmap and explore what `goat` could become.

## Enhanced Developer Experience

- **Lazy-Loading Interpreter (User Request):**
  - *Concept:* Develop an interpreter for the `Options` struct initialization (e.g., handling `goat.Default()`, `goat.Enum()`) that is extremely fast to start up. This would be beneficial in scenarios where `go build` time is part of the critical path for execution, and runtime speed of the interpreter itself is less critical than its initialization speed.
  - *Experimentation:* The current handling of `goat.Enum()` and `goat.Default()` can be seen as an early experiment in this direction, focusing on a limited subset of Go's syntax for fast parsing and evaluation without full compilation.
  - *Use Case:* Ideal for tools or scripts where the CLI definition might change frequently, and quick regeneration/re-evaluation is prioritized over the absolute runtime performance of the CLI parsing phase itself.

## Ideas for a Go Code Generation Helper Library (from codegen refactor)

*   **Problem Context:** The refactoring of `internal/codegen/main_generator.go` from `text/template` to direct Go code generation using `strings.Builder` was prompted by limitations in `text/template`. Specifically, fine-grained control over whitespace and newlines was challenging, and implementing complex conditional logic or nested structures within templates often led to code that was difficult to read, debug, and maintain.

*   **Benefits of Direct Generation:** Switching to `strings.Builder` and Go code for generation provided significantly improved control over the exact structure and formatting of the output. It also allowed for more natural expression of complex logic using standard Go control flow statements.

*   **Desired Features for a Helper Library:** A dedicated Go code generation helper library could abstract away some of the boilerplate of direct generation while retaining control. Key features could include:
    *   **Fluent API for Go Constructs:** Functions to easily generate common Go syntax elements like `if` blocks, `for` loops, variable declarations (`var x = y`, `x := y`), function calls, function declarations, struct literals, and package/import statements. For example, `gen.If("err != nil", funcBody...)` or `gen.Return("nil", "err")`.
    *   **Whitespace/Newline Management:** Provide sensible defaults for Go code formatting (e.g., automatic newlines after statements, proper indentation) but also offer fine-grained control when needed (e.g., `gen.Newline()`, `gen.Indent(level)`).
    *   **Import Management:** Automatically track types and packages used in the generated code and generate the necessary import statements, potentially grouping them (std, third-party, internal).
    *   **Code Block Abstraction:** Allow defining reusable Go code snippets or functions that can be parameterized and inserted into the generated output. This would be more powerful than simple string templating.
    *   **Reduced Verbosity:** The API should aim to be less verbose than raw `strings.Builder.WriteString("...")` calls for common Go syntax (e.g., `sb.WriteString("if x > 0 {\n")` vs. a higher-level `gen.If("x > 0", ...)`).
    *   **Error Handling:** Provide clear error reporting if the requested code structure is invalid or if there are inconsistencies in the generation request.
    *   **Formatting Integration:** Potentially integrate with `go/format` or a similar tool to ensure the final output is always well-formatted.

*   **Goal:** The ultimate goal would be to make direct Go code generation nearly as convenient as simple `text/template` usage for basic cases, while offering the full power, control, and debuggability of manual Go code for complex generation tasks. This could significantly improve the maintainability and robustness of code generation logic within tools like `goat`.
