# Future Dreams for Goat üêê

This document captures potential future enhancements, ambitious ideas, and 'dream' features for the `goat` tool. These go beyond the immediate roadmap and explore what `goat` could become.

## 1. Advanced CLI Generation Capabilities

- **Subcommand Support from Code Structure:** Automatically generate CLI subcommands based on nested structs within the `Options` struct, or perhaps by analyzing multiple `runXxx` functions in a package.
- **Positional Arguments:** Allow defining and parsing positional arguments in addition to flags, perhaps via struct tags or a different marker function.
- **Variadic Arguments:** Support for flags that can be repeated (e.g., `-I /path/to/include -I /another/path`) or collecting remaining arguments.
- **More Sophisticated Default Value Providers:** Instead of just static defaults, allow defaults to be sourced from configuration files (e.g., TOML, YAML, JSON) or even dynamic sources (e.g., a function call).
- **Plugin System/Extensibility:** Allow users to write plugins that can hook into the analysis or code generation process to customize behavior or add support for new option types or features.
- **Interactive Mode:** For CLIs with many options, offer an interactive mode that prompts the user for values, perhaps with autocompletion based on `goat.Enum()` or other metadata.
- **Shell Completions:** Generate shell completion scripts (Bash, Zsh, Fish) for the generated CLIs.

## 2. Enhanced Developer Experience

- **Lazy-Loading Interpreter (User Request):**
  - *Concept:* Develop an interpreter for the `Options` struct initialization (e.g., handling `goat.Default()`, `goat.Enum()`) that is extremely fast to start up. This would be beneficial in scenarios where `go build` time is part of the critical path for execution, and runtime speed of the interpreter itself is less critical than its initialization speed.
  - *Experimentation:* The current handling of `goat.Enum()` and `goat.Default()` can be seen as an early experiment in this direction, focusing on a limited subset of Go's syntax for fast parsing and evaluation without full compilation.
  - *Use Case:* Ideal for tools or scripts where the CLI definition might change frequently, and quick regeneration/re-evaluation is prioritized over the absolute runtime performance of the CLI parsing phase itself.

- **`goat init` Enhancements:**
  - Scaffold a complete, runnable example `main.go` with a sample `Options` struct, `NewOptions` function, and `RunApp` function.
  - Optionally initialize a Go module if one doesn't exist.
- **Live Preview/Dry Run for `goat emit`:** A mode to show the diff or the generated code without actually writing to the file.
- **VS Code Extension / LSP Support:** Provide language server features for `goat`-specific constructs, like autocompletion for marker functions or diagnostics for incorrect usage.
- **More Output Formats for `goat scan`:** Output metadata in formats other than JSON, such as YAML, or even generate documentation (e.g., Markdown for the CLI options).

## 3. Broader Integration and Ecosystem

- **Configuration File Loading:** Automatically generate code to load options from configuration files (e.g., `.env`, TOML, YAML) in addition to flags and environment variables, with clear precedence rules.
- **Integration with Build Systems:** Better integration with tools like Bazel or Make beyond just `go generate`.
- **Web UI Generator:** A far-fetched dream: Could `goat` analyze the `Options` and generate a simple web UI for triggering the command?

## 4. Performance and Internals

- **Advanced AST Caching:** For very large projects, implement more sophisticated caching of AST analysis results to speed up repeated `goat` invocations if source files haven't changed.
- **Parallel Processing:** Explore parallelizing parts of the analysis or code generation if significant performance bottlenecks are identified in large codebases.
- **Reduced Dependencies:** Continuously evaluate if all dependencies of the `goat` tool itself are necessary, to keep it lightweight.
