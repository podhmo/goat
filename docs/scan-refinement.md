# Scan Command Output Refinement Analysis

This document outlines findings from the analysis of `scan-result.json` files generated by the `goat scan` command. It identifies areas where the metadata extraction or representation could be improved.

The analysis was performed by comparing the `scan-result.json` output for the `examples/hello`, `examples/enum`, and `examples/fullset` projects against their respective source code and the `internal/metadata/types.go` definitions.

## Key Findings and Areas for Refinement

### 1. Interface Implementation Checks for Slice Types

*   **Observation**: The analyzer currently emits warnings and does not confirm `TextUnmarshaler` or `TextMarshaler` interface implementations for fields that are slice types (e.g., `[]string` for the `Features` field in `examples/fullset/main.go`).
    *   Example warning: `analyzer: warning: error checking TextUnmarshaler for field Features type []string: unsupported field type expression *ast.ArrayType for ImplementsInterface check`
*   **Current Behavior**: `IsTextUnmarshaler` and `IsTextMarshaler` are reported as `false` for these types.
*   **Impact**: This is a current limitation of the analyzer. While not necessarily incorrect (as `[]string` itself doesn't implement these), it means `goat` cannot currently leverage custom parsing/formatting for fields that are slices of a type that *individually* might support text marshaling/unmarshaling in a custom way if the slice itself was wrapped.
*   **Potential Refinement**:
    *   Document this limitation clearly.
    *   For future enhancements, explore if there's a meaningful way to detect or support scenarios where individual elements of a slice might implement these interfaces, though direct support on `[]string` is not standard.
*   **Relevant Files**: Primarily `internal/analyzer/analyzer.go` (specifically the logic for `ImplementsInterface`).

### 2. Default Value Representation for Complex Types with TextMarshaler

*   **Observation**: For fields of complex types that implement `encoding.TextMarshaler` (e.g., `net.IP` for the `HostIP` field in `examples/fullset/main.go`), the `DefaultValue` in `scan-result.json` is `null`, even when a non-nil default is provided (e.g., `goat.Default(net.ParseIP("127.0.0.1"))`).
*   **Current Behavior**: `DefaultValue` is `null`. `IsTextMarshaler` and `IsTextUnmarshaler` are correctly identified as `true`.
*   **Impact**: The JSON output doesn't convey the actual default value for these types, only that a default was conceptually set.
*   **Potential Refinement**:
    *   If `IsTextMarshaler` is true and a default value is successfully evaluated by the interpreter, store the text-marshaled string representation of the default value in `OptionMetadata.DefaultValue`. This would make the JSON output more informative.
    *   For example, for `net.IP` initialized with `net.ParseIP("127.0.0.1")`, the `DefaultValue` could become `"127.0.0.1"`.
*   **Relevant Files**: `internal/interpreter/evaluator.go` (when resolving default values from `goat.Default`) and potentially `internal/metadata/types.go` (to ensure `DefaultValue` can store this string representation or clarify its type).

### 3. Default Value for Pointer Fields Initialized with `goat.Default(<pointer_value>)` (Resolved)

*   **Previous Observation**: Previously, when an option field was a pointer type (e.g., `*string` like `ExistingFieldToMakeOptional` in `examples/fullset/main.go`) and initialized using `goat.Default()` with an actual pointer value (e.g., `goat.Default(stringPtr("was set by default"))`, where `stringPtr` returns `*string`), the `DefaultValue` in `scan-result.json` was incorrectly reported as `null`.
*   **Resolution**: This issue has been **resolved**. The interpreter (`internal/interpreter/interpreter.go`) has been updated.
*   **Current Behavior**: The interpreter now correctly dereferences the pointer value provided to `goat.Default` if the corresponding option field is a pointer type and the provided default value is a pointer-creating expression (such as a call to a helper function like `stringPtr()` or an address-of expression like `&myVar`). The actual underlying value is stored as the `DefaultValue`.
*   **Impact**: The `scan-result.json` now accurately reflects the default value for such pointer fields. For example, if `ExistingFieldToMakeOptional` is `*string` and initialized with `goat.Default(stringPtr("hello"))`, the `DefaultValue` in the JSON output is correctly `"hello"`.
*   **Relevant Files**: The fix was implemented in `internal/interpreter/interpreter.go`.

## Summary

The `goat scan` command provides valuable metadata. With the resolution of item 3, the accuracy and completeness of the `scan-result.json` output have been significantly improved, making it more reliable for debugging and for other tools that might consume this metadata. The remaining points (1 and 2) are current known limitations or areas for future enhancement.
