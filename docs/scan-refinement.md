# Scan Command Output Refinement Analysis

This document outlines findings from the analysis of `scan-result.json` files generated by the `goat scan` command. It identifies areas where the metadata extraction or representation could be improved.

The analysis was performed by comparing the `scan-result.json` output for the `examples/hello`, `examples/enum`, and `examples/fullset` projects against their respective source code and the `internal/metadata/types.go` definitions.

## Key Findings and Areas for Refinement

### 1. Interface Implementation Checks for Slice Types

*   **Observation**: The analyzer currently emits warnings and does not confirm `TextUnmarshaler` or `TextMarshaler` interface implementations for fields that are slice types (e.g., `[]string` for the `Features` field in `examples/fullset/main.go`).
    *   Example warning: `analyzer: warning: error checking TextUnmarshaler for field Features type []string: unsupported field type expression *ast.ArrayType for ImplementsInterface check`
*   **Current Behavior**: `IsTextUnmarshaler` and `IsTextMarshaler` are reported as `false` for these types.
*   **Impact**: This is a current limitation of the analyzer. While not necessarily incorrect (as `[]string` itself doesn't implement these), it means `goat` cannot currently leverage custom parsing/formatting for fields that are slices of a type that *individually* might support text marshaling/unmarshaling in a custom way if the slice itself was wrapped.
*   **Potential Refinement**:
    *   Document this limitation clearly.
    *   For future enhancements, explore if there's a meaningful way to detect or support scenarios where individual elements of a slice might implement these interfaces, though direct support on `[]string` is not standard.
*   **Relevant Files**: Primarily `internal/analyzer/analyzer.go` (specifically the logic for `ImplementsInterface`).

### 2. Default Value Representation for Complex Types with TextMarshaler

*   **Observation**: For fields of complex types that implement `encoding.TextMarshaler` (e.g., `net.IP` for the `HostIP` field in `examples/fullset/main.go`), the `DefaultValue` in `scan-result.json` is `null`, even when a non-nil default is provided (e.g., `goat.Default(net.ParseIP("127.0.0.1"))`).
*   **Current Behavior**: `DefaultValue` is `null`. `IsTextMarshaler` and `IsTextUnmarshaler` are correctly identified as `true`.
*   **Impact**: The JSON output doesn't convey the actual default value for these types, only that a default was conceptually set.
*   **Potential Refinement**:
    *   If `IsTextMarshaler` is true and a default value is successfully evaluated by the interpreter, store the text-marshaled string representation of the default value in `OptionMetadata.DefaultValue`. This would make the JSON output more informative.
    *   For example, for `net.IP` initialized with `net.ParseIP("127.0.0.1")`, the `DefaultValue` could become `"127.0.0.1"`.
*   **Relevant Files**: `internal/interpreter/evaluator.go` (when resolving default values from `goat.Default`) and potentially `internal/metadata/types.go` (to ensure `DefaultValue` can store this string representation or clarify its type).

### 3. Default Value for Pointer Fields Initialized with `goat.Default(<pointer_value>)`

*   **Observation**: When an option field is a pointer type (e.g., `*string` like `ExistingFieldToMakeOptional` in `examples/fullset/main.go`) and is initialized using `goat.Default()` with an actual pointer value (e.g., `goat.Default(stringPtr("was set by default"))`, where `stringPtr` returns `*string`), the `DefaultValue` in `scan-result.json` is `null`.
*   **Current Behavior**: `DefaultValue` is `null`.
*   **Impact**: This is a bug. The JSON output incorrectly suggests no default value was effectively set, whereas the code clearly provides one.
*   **Potential Refinement**:
    *   The interpreter, when evaluating `goat.Default(v)` for a pointer field, if `v` itself is a pointer to the type expected by the field (or a compatible type), should dereference `v` once to obtain the actual value to be stored as the default.
    *   For example, if `ExistingFieldToMakeOptional` is `*string` and initialized with `goat.Default(stringPtr("hello"))`, the `DefaultValue` in JSON should be `"hello"`.
*   **Relevant Files**: `internal/interpreter/evaluator.go` (specifically how it processes the argument to `goat.Default` for pointer type option fields).

## Summary

The `goat scan` command provides valuable metadata. Addressing the points above, especially item 3, would improve the accuracy and completeness of the `scan-result.json` output, making it more reliable for debugging and for other tools that might consume this metadata.
