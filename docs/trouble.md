## Build and Test Failures during `locator.go` Development

**Problem:**
During the development and testing of `internal/loader/locator.go` and its associated tests in `internal/loader/locator_test.go`, several issues were encountered:

1.  **`undefined: pkgName` in `internal/loader/locator.go`**: A variable `pkgName` was used in a conditional block without being declared in the outer scope, leading to an "undefined" error if that block wasn't entered.
2.  **`declared and not used: escapedModulePath` in `internal/loader/locator_test.go`**: A variable `escapedModulePath` was declared in the `setupMockGoModCache` helper but was not used.
3.  **Incorrect Package Name in Tests**: Tests like `TestGoModLocator_Locate_NoModuleContext` and `TestGoModLocator_Locate_CurrentModule` failed because the `PackageMetaInfo.Name` was being derived from the directory name (e.g., "testmodule" for `example.com/testmodule`). This is incorrect if the `package` clause in the Go files declares a different name (e.g., `package main`).

**Solution:**

1.  **`undefined: pkgName`**: The variable `pkgName` was declared with `var pkgName string` at the beginning of the `GoModLocator.Locate` method to ensure it's always in scope.
2.  **`declared and not used`**: The unused variable `escapedModulePath` was removed from `setupMockGoModCache`.
3.  **Incorrect Package Name**:
    *   A new helper function `getPackageNameFromFiles(dir string, goFiles []string) (string, error)` was added to `internal/loader/locator.go`. This function parses the `package` clause from the first Go file in the provided list to get the actual package name. It requires `go/parser` and `go/token` imports.
    *   `GoModLocator.Locate` was updated to use this helper when determining the package name for relative paths, module root packages, and dependency root packages. This fixed the failing tests and ensures more accurate package name resolution.

**Status:** All issues were resolved.
