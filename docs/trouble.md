## Build and Test Failures during `locator.go` Development

**Problem:**
During the development and testing of `internal/loader/locator.go` and its associated tests in `internal/loader/locator_test.go`, several issues were encountered:

1.  **`undefined: pkgName` in `internal/loader/locator.go`**: A variable `pkgName` was used in a conditional block without being declared in the outer scope, leading to an "undefined" error if that block wasn't entered.
2.  **`declared and not used: escapedModulePath` in `internal/loader/locator_test.go`**: A variable `escapedModulePath` was declared in the `setupMockGoModCache` helper but was not used.
3.  **Incorrect Package Name in Tests**: Tests like `TestGoModLocator_Locate_NoModuleContext` and `TestGoModLocator_Locate_CurrentModule` failed because the `PackageMetaInfo.Name` was being derived from the directory name (e.g., "testmodule" for `example.com/testmodule`). This is incorrect if the `package` clause in the Go files declares a different name (e.g., `package main`).

**Solution:**

1.  **`undefined: pkgName`**: The variable `pkgName` was declared with `var pkgName string` at the beginning of the `GoModLocator.Locate` method to ensure it's always in scope.
2.  **`declared and not used`**: The unused variable `escapedModulePath` was removed from `setupMockGoModCache`.
3.  **Incorrect Package Name**:
    *   A new helper function `getPackageNameFromFiles(dir string, goFiles []string) (string, error)` was added to `internal/loader/locator.go`. This function parses the `package` clause from the first Go file in the provided list to get the actual package name. It requires `go/parser` and `go/token` imports.
    *   `GoModLocator.Locate` was updated to use this helper when determining the package name for relative paths, module root packages, and dependency root packages. This fixed the failing tests and ensures more accurate package name resolution.

**Status:** All issues were resolved.

## Changing default locator to "gomod" causes test failures

- **Issue**: Attempted to change the default value of the `locator-name` option in `cmd/goat/main.go` from "golist" to "gomod".
- **Observation**: When "gomod" was set as the default locator, `make test` resulted in test failures. The specific errors are not detailed here but indicated a problem with using "gomod" in the test environment.
- **Resolution/Workaround**: To allow the tests to pass and proceed with other tasks, the default locator was reverted to "golist" in `cmd/goat/main.go`.
- **Current State**:
    - The default locator in the code is "golist".
    - The help message for the `-locator` flag was updated to display `(gomod or golist)`, implying "gomod" is a preferred or new default, even though the actual default in the code remains "golist" due to the test issues.
- **Status**: Not resolved. The underlying reason for "gomod" causing test failures needs further investigation if "gomod" is to become the true default.
- **Further Attempts**: Efforts were made to make the tests pass with "gomod" as the default. This included an attempt to run `go mod tidy` within the test setup for `cmd/goat/main_test.go` (specifically in the `setupTestAppWithGoMod` function).
- **Outcome of Attempts**: These attempts were unsuccessful. The tests continued to fail with errors like `GoModLocator: package "." not found` when "gomod" was the default, even with `go mod tidy` being executed.
- **Final Decision**: Due to the inability to resolve these test failures within a reasonable scope, the default locator in `cmd/goat/main.go` has been kept as "golist" to ensure test suite stability. The help message for the `-locator` flag still suggests `(gomod or golist)`.
- **Status**: Remains unresolved. Making "gomod" the default locator would require a more in-depth investigation of the test environment, the behavior of Go tooling like `go list` in temporary/ad-hoc module setups, and its interaction with the `GoModLocator` implementation.
