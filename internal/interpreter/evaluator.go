package interpreter

// This file would contain more sophisticated logic for evaluating expressions
// within the "subset language" of the Options initializer.
// For example, resolving variables, handling simple arithmetic for constants, etc.
// The astutils.EvaluateArg and astutils.EvaluateSliceArg provide a basic version of this.

// For now, astutils handles basic literal evaluation.
// Complex evaluations (e.g., var x = "foo"; opt.Val = x) would require a more
// stateful evaluator or symbol table within the interpreter.
